Make sure that _tkinter_ is installed.

Running the application:
- Navigate to the root of the repository
- Run python ```main_server.py -f name_of_sudoku```
- If no name is given, there will be a default sudoku
- Run python ```main_client.py -g```

If you want to add more sudoku puzzles, do the following:
- Create a sudoku puzzle as a csv file (empty fields filled with 0)
- Create another csv file with the solution to the sudoku puzzle
- Put both files in the _sudoku/puzzles_ folder
- It is important that the solution has the same name, with _solution added to it

For example if the sudoku puzzle is stored in the file _sudoku1.csv_ then the solution should be in the file _sudoku1_solution.csv_

It is highly recommended to run the application on Linux.
