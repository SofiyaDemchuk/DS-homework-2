Running the application:
- Navigate to the root of the repository
- Run python main_server.py -f name_of_sudoku
- If no name is given, there will be a default sudoku
- Run python main_client.py -g

If you want to add more sudoku puzzles, do the following:
- Create a sudoku puzzle as a csv file (empty fields filled with 0)
- Create another csv file with the solution to the sudoku puzzle
- Put both files in the sudoku/puzzles folder
- It is important that the solution has the same name, with _solution added to it

For example if the sudoku puzzle is stored in the file sudoku1.csv then the solution should be in the file sudoku1_solution.csv
